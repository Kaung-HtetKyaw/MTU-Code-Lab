# Renderless editable textarea

Following my previous article introducing a renderless component that [resizes a textarea](/renderless-resizable-textarea), we'll now explore one that can make all sorts of changes to a textarea's content.

Contrary to our `<resizable-textarea>` component that acted as a simple wrapper, our new `<editable-textarea>` will go one step further and allow us to control its behaviour from outside of the component.

<GithubButton url="https://github.com/lorisleiva/vue-lab/tree/master/components/editable-textarea" />

## Use and control

We simply wrap our component around a textarea and we give it a reference in order to control its behaviour.

```html
<editable-textarea ref="editor">
    <textarea></textarea>
</editable-textarea>
```

Then within the parent component, we can call any methods defined in the `editable-textarea` component.

```js
this.$refs.editor.wrapWith('**') // Toggles: bold
this.$refs.editor.wrapWith('*')  // Toggles: italic
this.$refs.editor.wrapWith('~~') // Toggles: strikethrough
```

And that's it. The parent component does not need to know anything about how this function is implemented or even listen to any events.

It only needs to know about the underlying "API" provided by the child component. It is then the parent's responsibility to provide the buttons that will trigger the use of its API.

## Components with magic wands âœ¨

The reference of such components can be seen as magic wands that control the entire ecosystem of an underlying black box, a.k.a Facades.

![Components with magic wands diagram](./Components-with-magic-wands.png#w90)

Such components are really powerful as they provide **reusable complex behaviour** with very **low coupling**.

## Diving into the component

Less theory more practice. Let's see how this `editable-textarea` works.

### Renderless

It simply renders whatever its wrapping.

```js
render () {
    return this.$slots.default[0]
},
```

### Get and update the textarea's content

First it has a method that extracts the content of the underlying textarea with the selection's position. Since we assume the component will be wrapping a textarea directly, we can access it using `this.$el`.

```js
methods: {
    getContent () {
        return {
            text: this.$el.value,
            start: this.$el.selectionStart,
            end: this.$el.selectionEnd,
        }
    }
}
```

For example, a textarea containing `Hello world` with `world` selected will return:

```js
{
    text: 'Hello world',
    start: 6, // Position of 'w'
    end: 11   // Position of 'd' + 1
}
```

It also has a complementary method that updates the textarea with a given text and selects it at the given positions.

```js
methods: {
    getContent () { ... },
    updateContent (text, start, end) {
    
        // Updates the textarea's value.
        this.$el.value = text
        
        // Trigger an 'input' event directly on the DOM element.
        triggerEvent(this.$el, 'input')

        // Select the right portion of text.
        this.$el.selectionStart = start
        this.$el.selectionEnd = end
        
        // Focus the textarea since we propably clicked on a button.
        this.$el.focus()

        return text
    },
}
```

As you can see we use a `triggerEvent()` helper function that triggers an event on the DOM element directly instead of relying on inter-component event communication. 

This frees the parent component of knowing which events to listen to and reduces coupling. If the parent component is using `v-model` or `@input` on the textarea, it will automatically be updated of any changes.

Now that we can get and update the text of the textarea we can have fun creating methods that follow this schema:

```js
let { text, start, end } = this.getContent()
// Do something with text, start, end.
return this.updateContent(text, start, end)
```

### Wrap selection with patterns

A very easy way to wrap the selected text within a pattern (like `**` for bold in markdown), is the following:

```js
wrapWith (pattern) {
    let { text, start, end } = this.getContent()
    
    // Cut the text before, inside and after the selection.
    let { before, selection, after } = cutTextWithSelection(text, start, end)

    // Add the pattern around the selection.
    before = before + pattern
    after = pattern + after

    return this.updateContent(
        before + selection + after,       // Reassemble the text
        before.length,                    // Start selection after `before`
        before.length + selection.length, // End selection after `before + selection`
    )
},
```

However, we might want the pattern to get removed if it already exists. Meaning if I call `wrapWith('**')` twice on `world` of `Hello world`, I expect `Hello world`, not `Hello ****world****`.

```js
wrapWith (pattern) {
    let { text, start, end } = this.getContent()
    let { before, selection, after } = cutTextWithSelection(text, start, end)

    // Check if the pattern is already around the selection.
    // Using lodash helper functions `startsWith` and `endsWith`.
    let removePattern = endsWith(before, pattern) 
        && startsWith(after, pattern) 

    // Add or remove the pattern around the selection.
    before = removePattern ? before.slice(0, - pattern.length) : before + pattern
    after = removePattern ? after.slice(pattern.length) : pattern + after

    return this.updateContent(
        before + selection + after,
        before.length,
        before.length + selection.length,
    )
},
```

![Kapture-2018-05-31-at-18.59.09](./Kapture-2018-05-31-at-18.59.09.gif#w100)

This works fine but we have a little conflict between bold `**` and italic `*`. If I call `wrapWith('**')` (bold) followed by `wrapWith('*')` (italic), I expect the result to be: `Hello ***world***` (bold + italic). Let's add a little exception in our method.

![Kapture-2018-05-31-at-18.57.25](./Kapture-2018-05-31-at-18.57.25.gif#w100)

```js
wrapWith (pattern) {
    let { text, start, end } = this.getContent()
    let { before, selection, after } = cutTextWithSelection(text, start, end)

    // Exception for bold and italic.
    let keepItalicPattern = pattern === '*' 
        && endsWith(before, '**') && ! endsWith(before, '***') 
        && startsWith(after, '**')  && ! startsWith(after, '***')

    // Do not remove the pattern if we add italic on bold.
    let removePattern = _.endsWith(before, pattern) 
        && _.startsWith(after, pattern) 
        && ! keepItalicPattern

    before = removePattern ? before.slice(0, - pattern.length) : before + pattern
    after = removePattern ? after.slice(pattern.length) : pattern + after

    return this.updateContent(
        before + selection + after,
        before.length,
        before.length + selection.length,
    )
},
```

And that's it. It might be a very small text editor but you have full control of it and it's already a bit smarter than GitLab's version. ðŸ˜˜

### Helper functions

Here's the code for the two helper functions that were used in the previous sections.

```js
function triggerEvent (el, type) {
    if ('createEvent' in document) {
        // modern browsers, IE9+
        var e = document.createEvent('HTMLEvents')
        e.initEvent(type, false, true)
        el.dispatchEvent(e)
    } else {
        // IE 8
        var e = document.createEventObject()
        e.eventType = type
        el.fireEvent('on'+e.eventType, e)
    }
}

function cutTextWithSelection (text, start, end) {
    return {
        before: text.substring(0, start),
        selection: text.substring(start, end),
        after: text.substring(end, text.length),
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Whilst those components as Facades are very powerful, they are not useful in every case. Sometimes some good all props with some events are more than enough. However for those cases where you need to extract complex and reusable behaviour from a component, they can be a great way to encapsulate that logic.

Another example of usage could be to open/close a modal from outside the component. Something like that:

```html
<user-delete-modal ref="modal"></user-delete-modal>
<button @click="$refs.model.open()">Delete account</button>
```

Remember also that we did not couple the component with its parent by adding some event communication. Therefore it is very easy to chain the `editable-textarea` component with the `resizable-textarea` component (in whichever order). See it for yourself:
